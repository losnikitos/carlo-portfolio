                            <p>The Flywheel is a response to the thought that the biggest shift is not technology itself but
                                the
                                perception we have towards energy. The USB port at the base of the charger is powered by the
                                user
                                spinning a large clay wheel that hangs between two pyramids.</p>
                            <p>Although the mass of the wheel is such that one spin sustains the rotation for several
                                minutes,
                                users
                                would need to spend an entire afternoon spinning the large, heavy wheel to fully charge
                                their
                                device.</p>
                            <p>The aim of the Flywheel is to give a human scale perspective on the amount of energy we carry
                                around
                                in our phones.</p>

                            <p>As part of a residency with Eindhoven based foundry Beeldenstorm I developed some projects
                                that
                                took advantage of their warm glass facilities.</p>

                            <p>The structure of this bowl references the stacked glass elements in a camera lens. Two pieces
                                of
                                6mm fused glass rest apposed to each other in the form of convex domes. The upper yellow
                                dish is
                                very shallow, while the green dome below has a depth of 20cm and reaches upward to almost
                                touch
                                the bottom of the dish above.</p>

                            <p>Version 2 has the addition of a foot ring which allows the light passed through the glass to
                                be
                                visible beneath the piece.</p>

                            <p>When primal instincts, desires, emotions and fears rise from the bottom of our subconscious to the forefront of our awareness we are forced to reconcile our waking consciousness in the material world with the primal elements that make us human. In this moment we are forced to reconcile how and why we are being alienated from a familiar or otherwise banal situation. The experience of searching for the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of this situation is defined as Uncanny. The most common example of this experience is Déjà vu, where a person is lost as to whether they experience the same situation twice, or possibly had a dream with the exact scenario. Since the seminal writing on this concept in 1919 by Freud, Das Unheimliche, artists, writers, film makers and engineers have explored the experience within their medium to create a deeper, more visceral connection with their audience. The projects Disruptive Fundamentals and Omnipotence of Thought are explorations in bringing this concept to Design with a focus on how archetypes and familiar shapes within designed objects can become a vehicle for the subconscious to rise out of the depths of our being.</p>

                            <p>For instance, the water carafe has a lip which indicates that it is a pouring vessel. However where the handle should be there is a void, a small opening similar to the one you may find at the base of a tree in a forest housing some kind of wildlife. One of the several motifs of the Uncanny are dismembered body parts as humans are predisposed to what is called the ‘castration complex’. We have an innate fear of losing extremities and appendages, and therefore are instinctually repulsed by scenarios where these elements could be in jeopardy. The pouring lip of the carafe indicates logically that a handle is located behind it. But when the user is confronted with the dark, hand-sized void, their knowledge of a basic functional archetype and their primal instincts conflict, and they are forced reconcile their subconscious with the object before them.</p>

                            <p>A chiminea is a small movable chimney. In the case of this design there is an inner vessel attached to the lid, so it is essentially two nesting vessels. The concept behind this piece comes from trying to take an element of film making and apply it to design.</p>

                            <p>In films directors often make use of a dramatic, long and slow reveal of a situation in order to build suspense and give the audience a more visceral sensation of being in the moment. I wanted to apply this mechanism to design in order to control the amount of time a user would be totally engaged with an object.</p>

                            <p>The cassette player is an experiment which combines the tactile qualities of mechanical
                                buttons
                                with hand built ceramics. The inspiration for this juxtaposition came from a core principal
                                of
                                the theory of the Uncanny: the duality of something strange yet simultaneously familiar. The
                                familiar sensation of pushing mechanical buttons subverts the users’ impression of the
                                ceramic
                                vessel. The row of buttons are the basic functions of a cassette player: play, pause,
                                rewind,
                                fast forward, stop. The rolling wheels actuate the left and right volume.</p>
                            <p>A primary challenge in fabricating this piece was accounting for the shrinkage of all the
                                ceramic
                                parts which eventually had to be retrofitted on top of recycled components from a cassette

                                digital content.</p>

                            <p>Functioning the same as the wheel of a computer mouse, the Scroll Wheel allows users to
                                navigate
                                up and down on a webpage which is diffused by a mirror and etched glass. The device harvests
                                and
                                modifies the screen glow of a digital device, the kind we can observe when we watch someone
                                use
                                a computer or cell phone in a dark room.</p>

                            <p>Due to the massive nature of the rolling wheel it becomes the primary element of the
                                experience,
                                while the content which is usually the main aspect fixated on is subverted to basic sensory
                                elements (color, moving lines).</p>
