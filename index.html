                            <p>The Flywheel is a response to the thought that the biggest shift is not technology itself but
                                the
                                perception we have towards energy. The USB port at the base of the charger is powered by the
                                user
                                spinning a large clay wheel that hangs between two pyramids.</p>
                            <p>Although the mass of the wheel is such that one spin sustains the rotation for several
                                minutes,
                                users
                                would need to spend an entire afternoon spinning the large, heavy wheel to fully charge
                                their
                                device.</p>
                            <p>The aim of the Flywheel is to give a human scale perspective on the amount of energy we carry
                                around
                                in our phones.</p>

                            <p>As part of a residency with Eindhoven based foundry Beeldenstorm I developed some projects
                                that
                                took advantage of their warm glass facilities.</p>

                            <p>The structure of this bowl references the stacked glass elements in a camera lens. Two pieces
                                of
                                6mm fused glass rest apposed to each other in the form of convex domes. The upper yellow
                                dish is
                                very shallow, while the green dome below has a depth of 20cm and reaches upward to almost

                                the bottom of the dish above.</p>

                            <p>Version 2 has the addition of a foot ring which allows the light passed through the glass to
                                be
                                visible beneath the piece.</p>

                            <p>The cassette player is an experiment which combines the tactile qualities of mechanical
                                buttons
                                with hand built ceramics. The inspiration for this juxtaposition came from a core principal
                                of
                                the theory of the Uncanny: the duality of something strange yet simultaneously familiar. The
                                familiar sensation of pushing mechanical buttons subverts the usersâ€™ impression of the
                                ceramic
                                vessel. The row of buttons are the basic functions of a cassette player: play, pause,
                                rewind,
                                fast forward, stop. The rolling wheels actuate the left and right volume.</p>
                            <p>A primary challenge in fabricating this piece was accounting for the shrinkage of all the
                                ceramic
                                parts which eventually had to be retrofitted on top of recycled components from a cassette
                                stereo.</p>

                            <p>The Scroll Wheel is a response to the new paradigm of scrolling through endless streams of
                                digital content.</p>

                            <p>Functioning the same as the wheel of a computer mouse, the Scroll Wheel allows users to
                                navigate
                                up and down on a webpage which is diffused by a mirror and etched glass. The device harvests
                                and
                                modifies the screen glow of a digital device, the kind we can observe when we watch someone
                                use
                                a computer or cell phone in a dark room.</p>

                            <p>Due to the massive nature of the rolling wheel it becomes the primary element of the
                                experience,
                                while the content which is usually the main aspect fixated on is subverted to basic sensory
                                elements (color, moving lines).</p>
